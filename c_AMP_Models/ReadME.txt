Here are three models used to prediction candidate AMPs (c_AMPs).
lstm.h5 for LSTM model, md5: 13a484aeef0eb3de129368d1e939c0b8
att.h5 for Attention model, md5: af736531da1dcc5b3381a6071f71fb08
BERT model can be dowload from: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o58xdznyi6ulyc6/AABLckEnxP54j2X7BrGybhyea?dl=0
md5 of bert model is 990d14de053d8080fcca33d712d647b6
After download these models should check their md5 value at first.
